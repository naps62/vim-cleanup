# vim-cleanup

A plugin that cleans up after you

# What exactly is this again?

1. A work in progress
2. At the moment, something that automatically cleans up unwanted whitespaces in
   your code
3. Currently only works in Ruby files (for no particular reason, that's simply
   where I've been testing it)
